This is a new repository of the iMustangs project at https://github.com/iMustangs/iMustangsV06.

This new repository was created to explore storyboard and to use the latest version of Xcode (4.2.1 at this time).

I primarly worked on the map overlays for this project, which involved:

- Creating a high resolution raster image overlay
- Creating tiles at different zoom levels for that raster image
- Adding the tiles to the map as a layer.

This version of the iOS app was in the Apple app store for about a year, under MSU2U, but has since been replaced by version 2 of MSU2U.
